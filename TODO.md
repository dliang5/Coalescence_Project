# sidenote on what I gotta do for this project and here
1. c
    Incoming updates after I finish the example algorithm to this: 
    1. change the key names to numbers in string form 
        1. unless I want to do a permutation of letters which is going to be weird after a while 
        2. Rationale: because there could be over 1k individual genomes (ex. Drosophila mel)
    2. optimize the search in the other functions
    3. create a pattern for the list pattern and create a picture of the tree somehow
    4. make sure the branch length is correct with the example online 

    Concerns and Disclaimer: 
    1. This algorithm is very biased towards whoever is the smallest first
        because of this, it is sub-optimal to the actual optimal one as it does not necessarily produce the correct "lineage" which may
        be of some concern
    2. my branch length may be off so I gotta double check on that later on 
1. That is for the nj algorithm tree and start understanding bedfiles
